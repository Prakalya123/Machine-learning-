# Machine-learning-
__Movie Recommendation System using KNN

__Project Overview

This project implements an Item-Based K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Movie Recommendation System using Python and scikit-learn.
The system recommends movies to users based on the ratings patterns of other users and items.

**Features

Item-based collaborative filtering using KNN.

Calculates similarity between movies using cosine similarity.

Recommends top K movies to users based on previously watched movies.

Evaluation using Precision@K and Recall@K metrics.

Works with sparse rating datasets.

__Dataset

The dataset contains user ratings for movies.

__Columns:

Column Name	Description
user_id	Unique ID of the user
item_id	Unique ID of the movie
rating	Rating given by the user (1-5)

Example datasets: MovieLens
 or Kaggle movie datasets.
